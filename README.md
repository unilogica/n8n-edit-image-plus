# Node with Alignment Enhancement for Edit Node

This repository contains an enhanced version of `node-base-edit-node`, a Node module for text editing with alignment support.

## Description

The `node-base-edit-node` is a Node module that allows text editing within a node environment. However, the alignment functionality in the original `node-base-edit-node` can be complex and challenging to use. This enhanced version adds improved alignment features to make the task of aligning text easier as needed.

## Added Features

- Left, center, and right text alignment.
- Enhanced user interface for alignment options selection.
- Example of a fictitious address aligned with different alignment options.
